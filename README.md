# 7.23 Qiqihaer Sports Arena Collapse Analysis Report
## 1. Introduction
* **Background**: Qiqihar is a prefecture-level city with a population of about 5 million in China, the second-largest in the northernmost and easternmost province of China, Heilongjiang. Qiqihaer's 34th middle schoolâ€™s gym that collapsed in this incident is reported to be built in 1997 with an area of 1,200 square metres. The accident killed 11 young women.
* **Objective**: This report aims to find out the main cause of the accident.

## 2. Accident details
The reason of collapse is commonly believed to be the wrongly placed building materials made of perlite on the roof. 
There was a construction project nearby and workers stacked perlite on the top of the gym for the sake of convenience. On Jul 23 a 30mm precipitation was reported and the perlite aborbed a large amount of rain water. The weight of perlite could be increased 2 - 16 times which could be the cause of the structural failure.
Noticeably the roof made of steel space frame collapsed as a whole, no steel member left with the support.
